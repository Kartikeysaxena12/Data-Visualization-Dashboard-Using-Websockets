# Dashboard Visualization Using React Three Fiber

## Overview

**Dashboard Visualization Using React Three Fiber** is a real-time dashboard application that demonstrates how to visualize dynamic data using React, WebSockets, and React Three Fiber. This project integrates a React frontend with a Node.js backend using Socket.IO to display real-time updates in both 2D and 3D formats. The project features interactive 3D visualizations, such as wedges representing feedback and rotating boxes, to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data:** Uses WebSockets to push real-time data updates to the client.
- **3D Visualizations:** Leverages React Three Fiber to create 3D visualizations, including custom shapes and interactive objects.
- **Interactive Charts:** Visualize data using a variety of chart types with Recharts and 3D elements with React Three Fiber.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure the dashboard is mobile-friendly and responsive.
- **Customizable Components:** Easily extend and customize components to fit different data visualization needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Recharts, React Three Fiber
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO
- **3D Rendering:** React Three Fiber, Three.js

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:** Contains the React application that connects to the WebSocket server to receive data and renders both 2D and 3D charts.
- **Backend:** Consists of a Node.js server that generates random data at intervals and emits them via WebSockets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- Basic understanding of React, Node.js, and 3D rendering with Three.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dashboard-visualization-react-three-fiber.git
   cd dashboard-visualization-react-three-fiber
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   For the backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   For the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

4. Run the frontend application:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the application:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, the dashboard will display both 2D and 3D charts that update in real-time. The data updates every second, showcasing how to handle dynamic data streams using WebSockets.

### 3D Visualizations

- **Feedback Visualization:** Displays a 3D pie chart using wedges to represent different feedback categories.
- **Three Visualization:** Renders a rotating 3D box to demonstrate basic 3D rendering capabilities.

## Customization

- **Charts:** Modify the chart configurations in the React component files to fit your data visualization needs.
- **3D Objects:** Customize the 3D visualizations by editing the `FeedbackVisualization.jsx` and `ThreeVisualization.jsx` components.
- **Styles:** Customize styles using Tailwind CSS classes or modify the `Websocket.css` file for additional styling.
- **Data Source:** Update the backend to connect to a real data source for more meaningful visualizations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues:** Ensure the WebSocket server is running and accessible at the specified endpoint.
- **Rendering Issues:** Check console logs for any errors related to 3D object rendering or chart data.
